## Datasets

Pretrain data to initialize our neurOps is hosted on [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1r9zyYzD2-GuNGgu2dSKAYg) (code:pld9). 
Or you can directly use the pretrained model weights provided in the repo.

### MIT-Adobe FiveK


There are two preprocessed versions of MIT-Adobe FiveK, in our paper, we refer them as MIT-Adobe FiveK-Dark (originally provided by [CSRNet](https://github.com/hejingwenhejingwen/CSRNet)) and MIT-Adobe FiveK-Lite (originally provided by [Distort-and-Recover](https://github.com/Jongchan/DISTORT-AND-RECOVER-CVPR18)). 

We host all these data in [百度网盘](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1GD1VzZhSoRG6qOQ55u2buQ) (code:jvvq)
